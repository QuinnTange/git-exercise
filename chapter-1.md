# Chapter 1

In the bustling hallways of Lincoln High School, a group of students gathered in the computer lab, their minds buzzing with excitement. They had a challenge ahead of them - to create a 2D fighting game with tanks as the main characters. This ambitious project was the brainchild of Sam, a tech-savvy junior who had a passion for game development.

The team consisted of five students - Sam, the project manager and lead developer; Emily, the graphic designer; Jake, the storyteller; Sarah, the sound designer; and Ben, the programmer. Together, they formed a formidable group, each bringing their unique skills to the table.

As they sat down at their computers, Sam opened up a blank canvas on the screen. "Alright, team, let's get started," he said, his voice filled with determination. "We need to come up with a concept for our game. Any ideas?"

Jake raised his hand, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "How about we set the game in a post-apocalyptic world where tanks have taken over and are battling for supremacy?"
